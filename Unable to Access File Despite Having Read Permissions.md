Title: User Unable to Access File Despite Having Read Permissions

Problem:

A user reports that they are unable to access or open a specific file, even though they have confirmed that they possess read (r) permissions on the file. 
The issue may not be related to the file's permissions alone and could involve other access control mechanisms or directory-level restrictions.

Troubleshooting/Diagnose

1. Verify File Permissions
   Check the file permissions and ownership:

		ls -l /path/to/file

   Ensure the user has read (r) permission through:

		• Ownership (user)
		• Group membership
		• Others (world-readable)

   Also confirm the user's identity:

		• id username
	
	
2. Check for ACL (Access Control List) Restrictions
   Even if traditional permissions are correct, ACLs may override them:

		• getfacl /path/to/file
	
3. Check SELinux Context (if enabled)
   If SELinux is enforcing, it may silently block access:

		• getenforce
		• ls -Z /path/to/file

	Look for denials in the audit log:

		• ausearch -m avc -ts recent
	
4. Check if the File is a Symlink
   If the file is a symbolic link, ensure the target path is valid and accessible:

		• ls -l /path/to/file
	
5. Check for File Locks
   A file may be locked by another process:

		• lsof | grep filename
	
	
Conclusion

		• Even with read permission, file access can be blocked by:
		• Lack of execute (x) permission on the parent directory
		• ACL rules
		• SELinux/AppArmor restrictions
		• Inaccessible symlink targets
		• Active file locks
